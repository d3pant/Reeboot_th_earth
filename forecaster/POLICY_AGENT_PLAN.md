# Policy Agent — Component Plan

Part of the Economic Resilience & Policy Coordinator (ERPC). Activated post-event
(all-clear signal from Forecasting Agent). Returns a structured eligibility list of
aid programs, grants, subsidies, and recovery initiatives the farmer qualifies for.

## File Location

`forecaster/agents/policy_agent.py`

Output written to: `forecaster/output/policy_report.json`

## Architecture

### Trigger
Post-event only. Called by ERPC when Forecasting Agent issues all-clear.
Input: farm profile + loss summary from Crop/Livestock agents.

### Loss Summary Input (Hardcoded Until Crop/Livestock Agents Exist)

The policy agent accepts an optional `loss_summary` dict. When `None`, all
loss-dependent eligibility fields fall back to hardcoded assumptions below.
Future work: Crop and Livestock agents will produce this dict and pass it in.

```python
# Hardcoded loss summary used when loss_summary=None
HARDCODED_LOSS_SUMMARY = {
    "crop_loss": True,               # triggers NAP, SDRP
    "livestock_loss": True,          # triggers LIP
    "livestock_deaths": True,        # triggers LIP specifically
    "forage_loss": True,             # triggers LFP, ELRP
    "infrastructure_damage": True,   # triggers ECP
    "forested_parcel_damage": False, # triggers EFRP — hardcoded False (no forested parcels)
    "watershed_damage": False,       # triggers EWP — hardcoded False
    "economic_injury": True,         # triggers SBA EIDL
}
```

### Disaster Event Date

Sourced from `forecaster/output/status.json` → `nearest_fire.detected_at`.
This is the fire's first detection timestamp, used to compute window-based deadlines
(e.g., "30 days from Notice of Loss", "8 months from declaration date").
Falls back to `status.json` → `timestamp` (forecaster run time) if `detected_at` is absent.
Make dynamic: replace with official FEMA declaration date once that API is integrated.

### Pipeline

1. **FEMA Declaration Check** (most important step)
   - Query OpenFEMA Disaster Declarations API filtered by `incidentType=Fire` and farmer's county + state
   - Result gates which USDA and FEMA programs are even available
   - Cache TTL: 6 hours in Stage 2, re-checked each Stage 1 cycle
   - Endpoint: `https://www.fema.gov/api/open/v2/DisasterDeclarationsSummaries`
   - Filter params: `?$filter=incidentType eq 'Fire' and state eq '{state}' and designatedArea eq '{county}'`

2. **Eligibility Engine**
   - Runs each program's rules against the farm profile
   - Returns: `confirmed` / `likely` / `check_required` / `ineligible`
   - Hard exclusions evaluated first (e.g., NAP blocked if farmer has federal crop insurance)

3. **Grants.gov Live Query**
   - Keyword search: `"wildfire agriculture"` and `"wildfire livestock"`
   - Free REST, no key required
   - Supplements hardcoded catalog with any newly opened grants
   - Endpoint: `https://api.grants.gov/v1/api/search2`

4. **Deadlines Cache Read**
   - Reads `data/program_deadlines_cache.json`
   - Written by a separate weekly scraper (not this agent) from `https://www.farmers.gov/working-with-us/program-deadlines`
   - If cache age > 7 days: log warning, proceed with stale data (never block on this)

5. **Output Assembly**
   - Sorted by: eligibility confidence (confirmed first), then by estimated value (descending)
   - Each item: program name, agency, eligibility status, deadline, required docs, estimated amount, link

## Farm Profile Fields Required (Currently Hardcoded in Agent)

These fields drive eligibility decisions. They are hardcoded as constants inside
`policy_agent.py`. Future work: move all of these into `farm_config.json` (or a
separate `farmer_profile.json`) and inject at runtime — no code changes needed in
the eligibility engine itself, just the data source.

`state` and `county` are now in `farm_config.json` → `location` and read from there.
All others remain hardcoded constants in the agent.

| Field | Type | Hardcoded Value | Drives | Make Dynamic From |
|-------|------|-----------------|--------|-------------------|
| `has_livestock` | bool | `True` | ELRP, ELAP, LFP, LIP | `farm_config.json` (derivable from zone `animals` count > 0) |
| `has_crops` | bool | `True` | NAP, SDRP | `farm_config.json` (derivable from zone `crops` list) |
| `has_federal_crop_insurance` | bool | `False` | NAP hard exclusion | `farmer_profile.json` |
| `has_nap_coverage` | bool | `True` | NAP (required pre-event) | `farmer_profile.json` |
| `has_forested_parcels` | bool | `False` | EFRP, EQIP | `farm_config.json` land type |
| `land_types` | list[str] | `["cropland", "rangeland"]` | EQIP, EWP | `farm_config.json` |
| `underserved_producer` | bool | `False` | ECP cost-share rate (75% vs 90%) | `farmer_profile.json` |
| `country` | str | `"US"` | FAO/GCF eligibility gate | `farmer_profile.json` |
| `has_approved_lfp` | bool | `False` | ELRP gateway dependency flag | `farmer_profile.json` |
| `state` | str | read from `farm_config.json` | FEMA declaration query | Already dynamic |
| `county` | str | read from `farm_config.json` | FEMA declaration query | Already dynamic |

## Data Sources

| Source | Used For | Auth | Caching |
|--------|---------|------|---------|
| OpenFEMA Disaster Declarations | Gates FEMA/USDA program availability | None | 6h TTL |
| OpenFEMA IA Housing | Confirms IA availability by county | None | 6h TTL |
| Grants.gov Search API | Live supplemental grants | None | 24h TTL |
| SAM.gov Assistance Listings | Full CFDA program eligibility rules | API key required | SKIPPED — out of scope |
| USDA FSA Program Handbooks | Detailed rule ingestion (RAG later) | None (PDF) | Static |
| Farmers.gov Program Deadlines | Live enrollment windows | None (scrape) | Weekly, separate job |

## Dependencies & Integration Points

- **Input from Forecasting Agent:** `forecaster/output/status.json` → `threat_level`, `nearest_fire.detected_at`
- **Input from Crop Agent:** `loss_summary` dict — hardcoded as `HARDCODED_LOSS_SUMMARY` until Crop Agent exists
- **Input from Livestock Agent:** folded into same `loss_summary` dict — same stub
- **Output written to:** `forecaster/output/policy_report.json`
- **Output to ERPC:** structured list of `EligibleProgram` objects (schema above)
- **Gateway dependency to flag:** LFP must be filed before ELRP auto-payment triggers — policy agent must surface this ordering in output

## Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Farm profile location | Hardcoded in policy agent | All eligibility fields listed in "Farm Profile Fields Required" table are hardcoded constants inside the agent. Future work: move to `farm_config.json` or a separate `farmer_profile.json` and inject at runtime. |
| SAM.gov | Skipped | Out of scope. Not included in data sources or eligibility engine. |
| Deadline scraper | `forecaster/scripts/scrape_deadlines.py` | Separate script, run weekly as cron job, writes to `forecaster/data/program_deadlines_cache.json`. Policy agent reads from cache; never calls farmers.gov inline. |
| Geographic scope | California only | State-level programs cover CA programs only: CalFire grants and CA Dept of Food & Agriculture disaster programs. Other states out of scope for now. |

---

## California State Programs (CA-only scope)

These supplement the federal catalog above. Eligibility gated on `state == "CA"`.

| ID | Program | Agency | Key Eligibility Rules (Hardcoded) | Link |
|----|---------|--------|-----------------------------------|------|
| CDFA_ERL | CA Dept of Food & Agriculture — Emergency Relief Programs | CDFA | CA farm or ranch; wildfire loss; governor's emergency declaration required | https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/grants/ |
| CALFIRE_FRAP | CAL FIRE — Forest Health Grants | CAL FIRE | Non-industrial private forest landowner in CA; reforestation or fire resilience work | https://www.fire.ca.gov/grants |
| CDFA_OEFI | CA Office of Emergency Food and Farming Infrastructure | CDFA | Small/mid-scale CA farm; food system disruption from disaster | https://www.cdfa.ca.gov/oefi/ |
| CA_EDD_DISASTER | CA EDD Disaster Unemployment Assistance | CA EDD | Farm workers or self-employed farmers who lost work due to disaster declaration | https://edd.ca.gov/en/unemployment/disaster/ |

> Note: CA state program eligibility rules are less machine-readable than federal programs.
> Deadlines and award amounts for CA programs are highly variable — treat all as `check_required`
> until a CA-specific deadline scraper is added.
